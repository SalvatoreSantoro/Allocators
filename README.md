# Allocators
This is a small library containing various commoddity memory allocators i'm mainly writing for myself so i don't guarantee about the quality of the software and the stability of the APIs.

## Actual state
At the moment the allocators supported are:
-Arena
refer to the relative folders for installation and API informations

## Platform supported
I'm aiming to make the code work both on Linux and Windows, but since i will mainly use it on Linux I don't guarantee that the code will work every time as expected.

Feel free to report bugs.

Thanks.
